## Problem Statment
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

## Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations. 

## Summary of Findings
- Total amount of hotel was higher for City Hotel (77,986) than Resort Hotel (37,029).
- One of the hypothesis is proved where when price is high, the number of cancellations is more
- 37% of cancellations impacted revenue, and the largest impact occurred in 2016.
- 36.05% cancelled their booking, 62.92% checked out while 1.03% didn't show up.
- A whopping 47% of cancellations are from users who booked through online travel agents.
- Portugal had the highest cancellations, with 23% or 27,000 cancellations.
- 

## Recommendations
- Cancellation rates rise as the prices does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotel could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on location. They can also provide some discounts to the customers.
- As the ratio of the cancelleation and not cancellation of the city hotel is higher than the resort hotel. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
- In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellations is the highest in this month.
- They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rates.
